# Project Description

This project is a shiny application that provides User Interface to use for predicting whether a customer will recommend your product based on product and service review text. The app depends on model developed using ![review classifier](https://github.com/agbleze/review_classifier.git) and ![packaged into prediction api service](https://github.com/agbleze/recommendation_predictor_API.git)

Description of those project which forms cornerstone of the app are also provided and can be viewed by clicking description from the dropdown menu while clciking of prediction shows the prediction UI.


## Running App UI standalone

Given the dependence of this app on a prediction api and the modular approach separating them individual services, it is best to run it as a docker container.

The docker image for this app has already been built and is available as agbleze/review_recommender_ui:latest

In case, you want to rebuild one yourself, user the Dockerfile in the repo for that.

## Running complete prediction service: App and prediction api

Given that the requires the prediction api url to provide full functionality, appropriate secret management that caters for both production deplyoment and ease of local deployment test is important.

To ensure that, the secrets HOST,PORT and ENDPOINT are to provided in .env or read directly from your secret vaults in production scenarios.


## Usage

The package provides a high level entrypoint to train model from the terminal. Detailed demonstration of this including dataset format expected is provided in docs/example.ipynb
